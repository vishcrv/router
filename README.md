1. Rule-Based Classification System
The selector uses predefined rules to categorize prompts into 4 main types:
Mathematical/Coding Tasks → DeepSeek R1

Keywords: "calculate", "solve", "equation", "math", "code", "program", "algorithm", "function", "debug"
Patterns: Mathematical expressions (2+3), Python syntax (def function_name, class ClassName, import module)
Confidence: 0.9 (highest)
Why DeepSeek: Better at step-by-step reasoning and logical problem solving

Reasoning/Logic Tasks → DeepSeek R1

Keywords: "analyze", "reasoning", "logic", "step by step", "explain why", "compare", "evaluate"
Patterns: Question structures like "why does...", "how can...", "what if..."
Confidence: 0.8
Why DeepSeek: Excels at analytical thinking and structured reasoning

Creative/Language Tasks → Mistral

Keywords: "write", "create", "story", "poem", "creative", "imagine", "describe"
Patterns: "write a...", "create a...", "tell me about..."
Confidence: 0.8
Why Mistral: Better for creative and expressive content

General Knowledge/Facts → Mistral

Keywords: "what is", "who is", "when", "where", "capital", "definition", "fact"
Patterns: "what is the...", "who is...", "when did..."
Confidence: 0.7
Why Mistral: Faster for quick factual responses

2. Scoring Algorithm
For each prompt, the system:
python# Step 1: Calculate keyword matches
keyword_matches = count_matching_keywords_in_prompt()
keyword_score = (matches / total_keywords) * rule_confidence

# Step 2: Calculate pattern matches  
pattern_matches = count_regex_matches_in_prompt()
pattern_score = (matches / total_patterns) * rule_confidence * 0.5

# Step 3: Add scores for each model
model_score += keyword_score + pattern_score
3. Prompt Analysis Bonuses
The system analyzes prompt characteristics and adds bonuses:
DeepSeek R1 Bonuses:

+0.3 if prompt contains code syntax or numbers
+0.2 if complexity indicators found ("complex", "analyze", "evaluate")
+0.1 if prompt is long (>20 words) - assumes complexity

Mistral Bonuses:

+0.3 if short factual question (question words + <15 words)

4. Fallback Logic
If all scores are too low (<0.1), defaults based on prompt length:

Short + question words → Mistral (0.6 confidence)
Everything else → DeepSeek (0.6 confidence)

5. Example Walkthrough
Let's trace: "What is the capital of India?"
python# Step 1: Keyword Analysis
matches = ["what is", "capital"] # 2 matches in factual rule
keyword_score = (2/8) * 0.7 = 0.175

# Step 2: Pattern Analysis  
matches = ["what is the"] # 1 pattern match
pattern_score = (1/3) * 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.117

# Step 3: Base Score
mistral_score = 0.175 + 0.117 = 0.292

# Step 4: Prompt Analysis
length = 7 words (short)
question_words = 1 ("what")
# Bonus: short factual question
mistral_score += 0.3 = 0.592

# Step 5: Normalization
# Mistral: 0.592, DeepSeek: ~0.1
# After normalization: Mistral = 1.0, DeepSeek = 0.17

# Result: Select Mistral with 1.0 confidence
6. Why This Logic Works
Efficiency

Makes decision before API calls (saves time/money)
Single model query vs multiple queries

Specialization

DeepSeek R1: Reasoning, math, code, analysis
Mistral: Facts, creativity, general knowledge

Adaptability

Multiple scoring factors (keywords + patterns + analysis)
Confidence scoring shows certainty level
Fallback ensures always makes a choice

Transparency

Shows reasoning: "Selected deepseek-r1 because prompt contains code"
Provides confidence scores for debugging

7. Key Design Decisions

Rule Priority: Math/Code gets highest confidence (0.9) because these tasks have clear indicators
Pattern Weight: Regex patterns get 0.5x weight vs keywords (less reliable)
Length Bias: Longer prompts → DeepSeek (assumes complexity)
Question Bias: Short questions → Mistral (assumes factual lookup)

8. Potential Improvements
The current logic could be enhanced with:

Machine learning classifier trained on prompt-performance data
Dynamic confidence adjustment based on historical accuracy
Context awareness for follow-up questions
Domain-specific rules (medical, legal, technical)

The beauty is it's interpretable - you can see exactly why each model was chosen, unlike a black-box ML approach!
